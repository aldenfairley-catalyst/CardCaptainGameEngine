# AI_SYMBOLS_WEBHOOKS.md

Updated: **2025-12-24 08:30 UTC**

This is reserved for later phases (AI generation + webhook integrations).

## Planned topics
- AI-generated graphs from natural language prompts
- Webhook format for remote validation + simulation
- Asset generation (card art) pipeline hooks
- Multiplayer event relay payloads

> For now, leave this file as a placeholder so agents don’t invent ad-hoc formats elsewhere.
